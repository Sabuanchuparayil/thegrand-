## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ (or use the version specified in `.nvmrc` if available)
- npm or yarn
- Sanity project ID and dataset

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
   
   Fill in your Sanity credentials and Metals.Dev API key:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
   SANITY_API_TOKEN=your_api_token
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
   
   # Metals.Dev for dynamic gold pricing (optional)
   METALS_API_KEY=your_metals_dev_api_key
   METALS_API_BASE_URL=https://api.metals.dev/v1
   
   # Optional: Secret for scheduled price updates (cron job)
   CRON_SECRET=your_random_secret_string
   ```
   
   **Note**: 
   - If `METALS_API_KEY` is not set, the system will use fallback gold prices.
   - Get your free API key from [Metals.Dev](https://metals.dev/) (100 requests/month free, $1.79/month for 2,000 requests).
   - The `CRON_SECRET` is optional but recommended for securing the scheduled price update endpoint.

4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## AR Features

### 2D AR (Face Tracking)
- Uses MediaPipe FaceMesh for real-time face tracking
- Supports necklaces and earrings
- Works in browser with camera access

### 3D AR (Model Viewer)
- Uses Google Model Viewer for 3D model display
- Supports WebXR, Scene Viewer, and Quick Look
- Works on iOS and Android devices

## Dynamic Pricing

The application supports dynamic pricing based on real-time gold market prices:

- **Metals.Dev API Integration**: Fetches current gold prices from Metals.Dev (free tier: 100 requests/month, paid: $1.79/month for 2,000 requests)
- **Automatic Calculation**: Prices calculated as (Gold Price × Weight × Purity) + Stone Value + Labor Cost
- **Pricing Models**: Products can use "fixed" or "dynamic" pricing
- **Product Fields**: 
  - `gold_weight`: Weight in grams
  - `stones`: Array of stone details (type, size, weight, quantity)
  - `labor_cost`: Base labor/markup cost
  - `pricing_model`: "dynamic" or "fixed"
- **Caching Strategy**: 
  - In-memory cache: 1 hour
  - Persistent file cache: 12 hours (updated twice daily via scheduled jobs)
  - Prices fetched twice daily (8 AM and 5 PM British time) to minimize API calls
  - **Total API calls: ~62/month** (2 calls/day × 31 days)
- **Fallback**: Uses base price if API is unavailable
- **Product Price Updates**: After fetching metal prices, all products with dynamic pricing are automatically updated using stored prices (no additional API calls)

### Scheduled Price Updates

The system is configured to fetch metal prices **twice daily** at **8 AM and 5 PM British time**:

**Vercel Cron (Recommended - if deployed on Vercel)**
- Already configured in `vercel.json`
- Runs automatically at 8:00 UTC and 17:00 UTC (8 AM and 5 PM GMT, 9 AM and 6 PM BST)
- No additional setup required

**Option 1: External Cron Service**
- Use services like [cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org) or [EasyCron](https://www.easycron.com)
- Schedule POST requests to: `https://your-domain.com/api/gold-price/scheduled`
- Include header: `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET`
- Schedule 1: 8:00 UTC (8 AM GMT / 9 AM BST)
- Schedule 2: 17:00 UTC (5 PM GMT / 6 PM BST)

**Option 2: Railway Cron Jobs**
- Add two cron jobs in Railway dashboard:
  - 8:00 UTC: `curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/gold-price/scheduled -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET"`
  - 17:00 UTC: `curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/gold-price/scheduled -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET"`

**What Happens During Scheduled Updates:**
1. Single API call to Metals.Dev fetches all metal prices (gold, platinum)
2. Prices stored in persistent cache
3. All products with `pricing_model: "dynamic"` are automatically updated
4. Product prices calculated using stored metal prices (no additional API calls)

**Manual Update**
- Call `GET /api/gold-price/scheduled?action=update` with authentication

**Cron Schedule (British Time)**
- 7:00 UTC = 8:00 AM BST / 7:00 AM GMT
- 16:00 UTC = 5:00 PM BST / 4:00 PM GMT
- Note: Times are set for BST (British Summer Time) which is active most of the year

### Testing the Price System

Run the test script to verify the system is working correctly:

```bash
npm run test:prices
```

Or directly:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-price-system.ts
```

The test script will:
- Check if stored prices exist and are valid
- Test price fetching from Metals.Dev API
- Test product price calculations
- Show summary of all products with dynamic pricing

### Monitoring

Monitor the price system health and recent updates:

**Health Check:**
```bash
curl https://your-domain.com/api/gold-price/monitoring
```

**With Recent Logs:**
```bash
curl https://your-domain.com/api/gold-price/monitoring?logs=true&limit=20
```

The monitoring endpoint provides:
- System health status
- Last update time and validity
- Product counts
- Recent update logs with timestamps and durations
